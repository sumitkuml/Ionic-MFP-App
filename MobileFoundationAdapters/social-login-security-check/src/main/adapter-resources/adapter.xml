	<displayName>Social Login adapter</displayName>
	<description>
        Provides integration with Google and Facebook sign-in.
        The client performs sign-in, obtains the vendor token, and sends it to the 'socialLogin' security check as a credentials parameter.
        The security check verifies the token with its vendor, and creates an MFP Authenticated User.
